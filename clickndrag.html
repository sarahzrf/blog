<h1 class="title">You’re Probably Implementing Click and Drag Wrong</h1>
</header>
<p>Any implementation of mouse-based interaction is basically a small
state machine that parses events. There are more possible user inputs in
more possible sequences than most people usually anticipate, though, and
as everyone knows, writing correct stateful code is impossible.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re trying to get basic click-and-drag behavior. You
have some kind of little widget or gadget in your webpage that you want
the user to be able to drag around and have follow the mouse as it
moves. The relevant events, obviously, are <code>mousedown</code>,
<code>mousemove</code>, and <code>mouseup</code>.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> You
might write something like this:</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="525" src="//jsfiddle.net/gan5psb7/embedded/js,html,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0">
</iframe>
<p>This example is bugged in a fairly obvious way. If you pick up the
circle, try to leave the box it lives inside, and then let go, it will
be stuck to the cursor when you mouse back over that box.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> No
button is being held, but the state machine is still in the dragging
state, because it has no transition that accounts for letting go of the
mouse button anywhere besides inside the box. The most obvious fix is to
register <code>mouseup</code> on <code>document</code> instead. It turns
out that if you do this, the event will fire even when the mouse is
outside of the window, so you can drag all the way to the titlebar
before letting go, and it won’t stick to the cursor when you come
back:</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="525" src="//jsfiddle.net/moyct7vf/embedded/js,html,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0">
</iframe>
<p>This is, as far as I can tell, approximately what many websites do,
but it is still wrong, albeit in a much subtler and less frequently
relevant way. I said <code>mouseup</code> fires on <code>document</code>
even when the mouse is outside of the window, but this is actually only
half true: It will fire if you press a button inside the window, move
the cursor outside of the window, and then let go, leaving the window
focused the entire time, but situations other than this one get much
worse. This same process but changing which window has focus in the
middle appears to give different results between browsers and platforms;
Chromium on Linux<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> still fires an event for me, but
Chrome on Windows and Firefox on either OS both seem to regard the
cursor as a lost cause. Changing desktops or tabs while the mouse is
held down also results in no <code>mouseup</code> event on
<code>document</code> when I let go in either Firefox or Chrome on
either Linux or Windows.</p>
<p>This means you can still get a sticky circle in the “fixed” version
above with a little more effort. Simply pick the circle up, press
ctrl+tab, let go, and come back. Or if you prefer, try it on your
favorite website with click-and-drag functionality! I’ve found that
Desmos, Proton calendar, and <a href="https://q.uiver.app/">quiver</a>
(which is regardless great and you should check out) are broken in this
way. Gmail is broken in Firefox but not Chrome for reasons completely
beyond me that have probably nothing to do with the fixes I propose
below. Google Drive is mostly non-broken; if you pick up a file, tab
out, let go, <em>leave your mouse outside of the window</em>, and come
back, the file will be left floating until you mouse back over the
document, but the drag will end once you do.</p>
<p>So how to make the circle no longer sticky? One imperfect possibility
would be to add an additional <code>blur</code> event handler on
<code>window</code>. The <code>blur</code> event will fire when the
window loses focus. If we end any drags in progress when this event
fires, we should get a safe underapproximation of the true mouse state:
If the button is lifted without the window ever losing focus,
<code>mouseup</code> will fire on <code>document</code>, and if the
window loses focus, <code>blur</code> will fire on
<code>window</code>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Here’s a version of the demo with
the new handler:</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="550" src="//jsfiddle.net/n0pw8odr/embedded/js,html,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0">
</iframe>
<p>This still isn’t perfect, though. It’s sort of unexpected that
alt-tabbing to a non-overlapping window will cause a drag to abruptly
end, for example, and it would make sense that if you never let go of
the mouse while tabbing out and back, then a drag should continue when
you return. An alternative which would fix these issues and which I
imagine is roughly what Google Drive does would be to treat every
<code>mousemove</code> event as an extra opportunity to check for an
absence of depressed mouse buttons:</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="600" src="//jsfiddle.net/bLpoes68/embedded/js,html,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0">
</iframe>
<p>This still isn’t quite as perfect as Gmail in Chrome. I have no idea
what they’re doing, though!</p>

Drag and Drop API</a>, but it’s intended more for integration with the
native OS idioms of dragging and dropping than for continuous movement
of objects around within within your app—for example, it will by default
automatically create an afterimage of the dragged object that follows
the user’s cursor which can leave the window and whose movement you
